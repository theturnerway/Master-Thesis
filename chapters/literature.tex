\part{Theory section}
In this first theory part the basis of finite element modeling will be laid out, including some basic founding notions of non-linear FEM in chapter 3 then in chapter 4 hyperelastic material models followed by contact modeling in chapter 5. Finally and overview in how metamodels can be used and implemented is given in chapter 6.
